#ActiVCS

To run the application, please download the ActiVCS.jar and the RegularExpressions.csv file. <br/>
These two files have to be in the same directory or the application will not be able to identify activity labels.<br/>

The regular expressions stored in the .csv file were defined by Vasilescu et al. (2014): <br/>
"On the variation and specialisation of workloadâ€”a case study of the Gnome ecosystem community." <br/>
The regular expressions were altered to enable the application in a Java environment (added escape characters).<br/>

Create git logs with the following command: git log --reverse --name-status > filename<br/>
Use the ActiVCS tool to analyze the files<br/>
