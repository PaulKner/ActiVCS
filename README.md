#ActiVCS

To run the application, please download the ActiVCS.jar and the RegularExpressions.csv file.
These two files have to be in the same directory or the application will not be able to identify activity labels.

The regular expressions stored in the .csv file were defined by Vasilescu et al. (2014): 
"On the variation and specialisation of workloadâ€”a case study of the Gnome ecosystem community." 
The regular expressions were altered to enable the application in a Java environment (added escape characters).

Create git logs with the following command: git log --reverse --name-status > filename
Use the ActiVCS tool to analyze the files
